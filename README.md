# Pong-Game
Play the pong game with a friend or against yourself!(Python) With 3 different classes and utilizing class inheritance from the turtle library, welcome to pong in Python! Each hit to the paddle slightly increases the speed, but after you or your partner scores, the ball resets to the middle as well as the speed resets. The keys for player 1 are "w" and "s" and for player 2 are "up" and "down". I customized the colors to orange and blue (Go Gators) but feel free to add your own twists! Also, I added relaxing game music using playsound.
